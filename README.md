# Printer

Hey folks! I've had this idea rolling around in my head, and I'm ready to kick it off.

I'd like to put together a group to design a 3D printer. There are lots of home grown 3D printer designs out there. See for example [http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Machines](http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Machines). We'd mostly be selecting elements from existing printers to create a new combination, not developing any new technology. The goal I'd like to pursue is: few parts and ease of assembly/upgrade.

To throw a few words out there, it'll be a delta printer. That means it will look something like this: [https://youtu.be/KroO4_xwKcs](https://youtu.be/KroO4_xwKcs). It'll have a lead screw drive, with magnetic ball effector joints, and the structural base and top will be 3D printed. You'll know what all of that means later. (: Build cost will be less than $300.

I figure we'll meet once a month for four or five months. We'll start off with a small list of parts to buy, and add to it as we assemble the printer.

Though all of the technology is already out there, we will have to design some 3D printed parts. For that, there's a cool language called OpenSCAD. It's like 3D geometry meets Python, and easy to pick up. There are simple parts that we'll have to design, and also more complicated parts that we can either design or crib from other printers.

I'll bring sufficient experience with 3D printers: I've built a couple from kit so far. You can collaborate on the design of the printed parts, or just come and learn/assemble. Of course, I'll print all of the printed parts we need. I'll be doing this project with or without you, but of course it would be great to work together. (: I might rope in a few other friends.

I'm not sure how to best put a group together. But if you want to join, then star *this* repo ([https://github.com/LegendaryOctoSniffle/Printer](https://github.com/LegendaryOctoSniffle/Printer)) ; I'll invite you to the group and figure out how to get in touch. Tentatively I'm thinking to make our first meeting 1pm on ~~March 10th~~ March 11th.

Cheers!
