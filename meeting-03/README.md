# Meeting 03 - Saturday, July 7th. 1PM-3PM. University of Washington Campus (Suzzallo 333)

In this meeting, we will finish off the *structural* elements of our printer. In our next (and final) meeting, we will complete the *electrical* components of our printer.

## Parts

Here are the parts that you will need to purchase:

* 2020 Aluminum Extrusion (600mm) (x1)
  Yes, just one! [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322880737350)
* T8x2 Leadscrew w/nut (500mm) (x2)
  Last time you bought 400mm. This time, buy two of the *500mm*. I'll swap you in third 500mm lead screw. Make sure that they are T8x2 screws. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322001200138?var=510950737978)
* Stepper Motor (Nema17, 1.7A) (x3)
  You have already bought one of these. Buy three more. You'll need two for the other two legs, and one for the extruder: the motor that pushes filament through the print head. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/321966121485)
  
The quantities are weird because I'm making a shorter printer to fit on my counter, and I'll be giving you some of my longer parts. If you've already bought all three of your 2020 extrusions and lead screws, then that's not a problem!
