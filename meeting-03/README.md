# Meeting 03 - Saturday, July 7th. 1PM-3PM. University of Washington Campus (room TBD)

In this meeting, we will finish off the *structural* elements of our printer. In our next (and final) meeting, we will complete the *electrical* components of our printer.

## Parts

I'm making a couple of changes to a couple of parts sizes: I think that a couple of previous parts were too small.

For the parts that you have already purchased, I will swap you out larger parts for your smaller ones. This will work well, because I want to make a smaller printer anyway. (:

Here are the parts that you will need to purchase:

* 2020 Aluminum Extrusion (600mm) (x2)
  We'll be assembling the other two legs of our printer! [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322880737350)
* T8x2 Leadscrew w/nut (500mm) (x2)
  Last time you bought 400mm. This time, buy two of the *500mm*. I'll swap you in third 500mm lead screw. Make sure that they are T8x2 screws. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322001200138?var=510950737978)
* Stepper Motor (Nema17, 1.7A) (x3)
  You have already bought one of these. Buy three more. You'll need two for the other two legs, and one for the extruder: the motor that pushes filament through the print head. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/321966121485)
