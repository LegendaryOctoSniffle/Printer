## Outline

1. If you've designed a carriage/sled, then I'll print it and bring it! I'll print enough copies of at least one design for everyone to have one.
2. I'll bring some extra hardware (screws and tools) so that we can assemble the carriage, lead screw nut, and smooth rod.
3. I'll bring playdough, so that we can prototype the following parts:
  * Endstop switch setoff.
  * Pillow block bearing setoff.
  * Hardware to capture the smooth rod.
  * Structural top and base
4. I'll bring the effector joint magnets, and describe how they'll attach to the sled.
